# Weather App

This project was Technigo's Bootcamp project of week 6. The goal was to build a simple weather dashboard that tells today's weather and temperature and a 5-day forecast using a weather API by fetching the external data to the website. The project was done in a group of five people (Lovisa, Dorothea, Tiina, Mimmi and Kristiina).

**General Requirements**

- Contribute by helping others with this project on Stack Overflow.
- Demo your solution for the rest of the team.
- Code follows Technigoâ€™s code guidelines.
- Publish your site on Netlify.

*Minimum Requirements*

- You should fetch data from the API using `fetch()` in JavaScript
- All data in the sketch above should be present and fetched from the API
- The presentation of the data should be in the specified format.
- The page should work on mobile (mobile first!), tablet and desktop (Be responsive)
- Step 1 & 2 should be done together and step 3 should be done in branches

## The problem

We divided our group into two smaller groups and divided the work into 2 branches (1. branch: today's weather section and 2. branch: forecast weather for the next 5 days). 

We built an input form to give the user the possibility to search weather for different cities. We created a function with conditional statements which is changing the background depending on the temperature of the searched city. We used conditional statements for also changing the weather icons for current and future weather.
